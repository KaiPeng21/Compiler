# This is a compiler project from Purdue University
# The compiler compiles a subset of Micro language,
# a programming language similar to C, to an
# assembly instruction set called "tiny"


# Execute the following commands to run the file

export CLASSPATH=<location of antlr.jar>

make

runme <input micro file path> <output file path>

# Use the following instruction to test

# 1. Create Micro file and input file and put it in atestin directory
# 2. run the following command

atest

# or

atest <filename>

# or

atest200 # to use the 200 register version
